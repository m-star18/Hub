# Contributor License Agreement Background Information

We are incredibly thankful for the thousands of contributions we receive from the community. We require our external contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") in order to ensure that our projects remain licensed under Free and Open Source licenses such as MPL2 while allowing Snark AI, inc (henceforth referred to as Activeloop) to build a sustainable business.

Activeloop is committed to having a true Free and Open Source Software ("FOSS") license for our non-commercial software. A CLA enables Activeloop to safely commercialize our products while keeping a standard FOSS license with all the rights that license grants to users: the ability to use the project in their own projects or businesses, to republish modified source, or to completely fork the project.

The next section gives a human-friendly summary of our CLA, details on why we require a CLA, how contributors can sign our CLA, and more. You may view the full legal CLA document [here](https://github.com/activeloopai/Hub/blob/master/LICENSE).

# Human-Friendly Summary

This is a human-readable summary of (and not a substitute for) the full agreement. This highlights only some of the key terms of the [CLA](https://github.com/activeloopai/Hub/blob/master/LICENSE). It has no legal value, and you should carefully review all the [terms of the actual CLA](https://github.com/activeloopai/Hub/blob/master/LICENSE) before agreeing.
- Grant of copyright license. You give Activeloop permission to use your copyrighted work in commercial products.
- Grant of patent license. If your contributed work uses a patent, you give Activeloop a license to use that patent including within commercial products. You also agree that you have permission to grant this license.
- No Warranty or Support Obligations. By making a contribution, you are not obligating yourself to provide support for the contribution, and you are not taking on any warranty obligations or providing any assurances about how it will perform.

The CLA does not change the terms of the standard open source license used by our software such as MPL2. You are still free to use our projects within your own projects or businesses, republish modified source, and more. Please reference the appropriate license for the project you're contributing to to learn more.

# Why Require a CLA?
[Agreeing to a CLA](https://github.com/activeloopai/Hub/blob/master/LICENSE) explicitly states that you are entitled to provide a contribution, that you cannot withdraw permission to use your contribution at a later date, and that Activeloop has permission to use your contribution in our commercial products.

This removes any ambiguities or uncertainties caused by not having a CLA and allows users and customers to confidently adopt our projects. At the same time, the CLA ensures that all contributions to our open source projects are licensed under the project's respective open source license, such as MPL2.

Requiring a CLA is a common and well-accepted practice in open source. Major open source projects require CLAs such as Apache Software Foundation projects, Facebook projects (such as React), Google projects (including Go), Python, Django, and more. Each of these projects remains licensed under permissive OSS licenses such as MIT, MPL2, Apache, BSD, and more.

# Signing the CLA
Upon submitting a pull request, you will be prompted to sign in the CLA we will ask you to provide your Name, Email-address and your Github profile to sign-in.
We will only use this information for CLA tracking; none of your submitted information will be used for marketing purposes.

You only have to sign the CLA once. Once you've signed the CLA, future contributions to any Activeloop project will not require you to sign again.
